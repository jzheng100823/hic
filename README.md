These are the files to the project 
you can run this on locally by copying the folders and running it 
using any text editor or how you run html code.
The website is also hosted at
https://jzheng100823.github.io/hicproj/.
We made a couple of changes from our original design in Balsamiq. One change is the addition of a contact page 
where users can submit their questions or concerns.  We also changed the way the vehicles
are displayed on each page.
